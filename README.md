## About

GMBullet is an extension that exposes
[Bullet physics](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) functions to
GameMaker. Its goal is not to be a simplification layer, but instead it tries to
match Bullet's API as closely as possible.

## Translating API

Bullet's C++ public API is converted into a C-like code and exposed to GML. This
is how to find a GMBullet equivalent to a Bullet function:

### Constructors and destructors

In GMBullet, these are the class name appended with `_create` or `_destroy`. For
example:

```cpp
// C++
btDiscreteDynamicsWorld* dynamicsWorld = new btDiscreteDynamicsWorld(
    dispatcher, pairCache, constraintSolver, collisionConfiguration);

delete dynamicsWorld;
```

becomes

```gml
// GML
var dynamicsWorld = btDiscreteDynamicsWorld_create(
    dispatcher, pairCache, constraintSolver, collisionConfiguration);

btDiscreteDynamicsWorld_destroy(dynamicsWorld);
```

If a Bullet class/struct has multiple constructors, in GMBullet these are available
as separate functions. For example these are the constructors of `btQuaternion`
available in GMBullet:

```gml
// GML
btQuaternion_create(x, y, z, w);
btQuaternion_createFromAxisAngle(axis, angle);
btQuaternion_createFromEuler(yaw, pitch, roll);
```

If a Bullet class/struct is defined inside of a namespace or another class/struct,
the GMBullet name is just the class/struct name (prepended with `bt`, if missing),
without the namespace. For example, `btCollisionWorld::ClosestRayResultCallback`
becomes just `btClosestRayResultCallback`.

### Methods

In GMBullet, these are the class name appended with underscore, followed by the
method name. The first argument of a method is always a pointer to the class
instance. For example:

```cpp
// C++
btVector3 gravity(0.0, 0.0, -9.8);
dynamicsWorld->setGravity(gravity);
```

becomes

```gml
// GML
var gravity = btVector3_create(0, 0, -9.8);
btDiscreteDynamicsWorld_setGravity(dynamicsWorld, gravity);
btVector3_destroy(gravity);
```

### Return values

Instead of allocating a new class/struct and returning those directly, GMBullet
uses output parameters, appended to the end of the original function. For example:

```cpp
// C++
btVector3 gravity = dynamicsWorld->getGravity();
// Use gravity...
```

becomes

```gml
// GML
var outGravity = btVector3_create();
btDiscreteDynamicsWorld_getGravity(dynamicsWorld, outGravity);
// Use outGravity...
btVector3_destroy(outGravity);
```

### Public properties

Public properties of classes/structs in Bullet are exposed via getters and setters
in GMBullet. For example for `m_hitPointWorld` of `btClosestRayResultCallback`,
there's a getter `btClosestRayResultCallback_getHitPointWorld`.

### Operators

**Operator overloads are currently not exposed in GMBullet!** (But when they're
added, they are most likely going t be `_add`, `_sub`, `_mul` and `_div`,
appended to the class/struct name.)

## Documentation and help

Bullet itself is quite poorly documented and I myself am no Bullet guru, so the
absolute most of the GMBullet documentation was generated from source code using
[ChatGPT 3.5](https://chat.openai.com). For the most part, it seems quite good,
but sometimes it looks like complete BS. But hey, it's better than nothing! The
best way to learn Bullet remains to be using
[examples](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/tree/master/examples)
included in the official repo. In case you need help with GMBullet, you can join
the [BlueBurn Discord server](https://discord.gg/ep2BGPm), where I will try to
do my best to answer your questions. This repo also contains a sample GM project
to help you get started.

## Building from source

Requires [CMake](https://cmake.org) version 3.23 or newer!

```sh
# Clone the repo, including submodules
git clone https://github.com/blueburncz/GMBullet.git --recurse-submodules

# Build Bullet
cd GMBullet/bullet3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=ON
cmake --build . --config=Release

# Build GMBullet
cd ../../
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config=Release
```
